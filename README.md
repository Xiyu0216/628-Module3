The purpose of this project is to perform a modern statistical analysis from the **business** dataset. Our methodology includes:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: to investigate the variables' distributions along with the outliers
- **Data cleansing**: to clean the data by imputing some observations which areirrational and create a new cleaned dataset
- **Statistical Model**: to construct a model that effectively infers and describes the variables based on the existing data. We also conduct the experiment to select the best model
- **Model diagnostics**: to investigate the proposed model whether it is appropriate for predicting body fat using several plots and tests for model assumptions
- **Model strengths and weaknesses**: to analyze the finalized model and its prediction performance. We also include the discussion for the improvement and future work
- **Shiny App**: to develop a real-time web application and predict a based on our model

### Content
#### data
- This contains both raw and cleaned data sets we used in the analysis.

#### code
- This contains R scripts for the analysis ranging from reading data, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, data modeling to model diagnostics as well as script for Shiny app.

#### image
- This contains images obtained from the code and analysis such as figures, tables, and plots.

#### Executive Summary
- The two-page document that summarizes the analysis including the introduction, data cleaning, model selection and diagnostics as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
